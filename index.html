                <p>Started doing basic ground becuase we are going to work on existing code. Immediatly we started analysing the design and noted down the points where we thought to add improvement and tried our best to comeup with new design to suggest our guide. Once done with it satrted going through the code and trying to understand each and every component which is implemented and end of the week as praveen sir added suggestion we have to work according to that.</p>

                <p>So our sprint 2 didn't get reviwed as of now, as mentioned by praveen sir we explained our work and recording sent to sir for review. Appreciated our work and got few suggestions to work on. We tried to put our best to reach expections, worked on all those pages and completed maximum suggestions but we are still working on presentation page to design a line graph and transcript page to freeze the table in a responsive view. We will wait for the review from Praveen sir and we will continue from here accordingly.    </p>
