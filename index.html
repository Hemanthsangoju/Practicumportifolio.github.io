              <div class="w3-container">
                <p>Started doing basic ground becuase we are going to work on existing code. Immediatly we started analysing the design and noted down the points where we thought to add improvement and tried our best to comeup with new design. Satrted going through the code and trying to understand each and every component which is implemented and we decided the approachhow to work on each and every component.</p>

              <div class="w3-container">
                <p>We have presented our work through vedio by explaining each and every teammate to review our work. Worked on all those pages and made required changes to all the components and still work on presentation page to design a line graph and transcript page to freeze the table in a responsive view.</p>

              <div class="w3-container">
                <p>We started week with working on presentation page(bar graph). Average line is being displayed in the graph with some changes in the components. We started working on transcript page for pdf trying to mention download button is displayed with jason format. Our work on bar graph in the download option findng pdf with complete page printing. Started taking action on the approach of back end integration, trying to find different resouces for CSV file. Wrote script for backend work there is a lot of data to be configured.</p>

              <div class="w3-container">
                <p>The first day of week started by working on presentation page and make few changes on conponents which gives perfect display visualization. Immediate step we started doing Technical mock interviews page came up with a design and prepared one smaple CSV sheet for test purpose but had most of the data accurately. We similarly worked on flask task and git task tried to get clarified by using few resources. So similarly worked with backend part google cloud becuase we palned to use GCP from now onwards for data storage purpose. Explored all the services completely include pricing process.</p>

                <p>Strated working on techical mock interview page components, after doing research on the components deeply finally come up with the design outline and able to add vedio links. We have appended sample data into table and tested this page it is working as we expected. Worked on overall grade summary page and displayed bar graph for each and every course by mentioning few compnents like on what graph how many people secured. Completely displayed web view and those compnets with chatjs we worked and still need to work on mobile responsive view.</p>
